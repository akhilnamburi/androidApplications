        <item>\nInformation\n\n Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team.
            He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket.
            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen,
            and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries,
            the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI,
            and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. He is colloquially known as Little Master or Master Blaster, In 2001, Sachin Tendulkar
            became the first batsman to complete 10,000 ODI runs in his 259 innings. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers Almanack ranked him the second greatest
            Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the
            Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[12] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the
            2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th
            anniversary of Wisden Cricketers Almanack.\n
             In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the Most Influential People in the World. In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his
            retirement from ODIs.[27] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013 and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing
            his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbais Wankhede Stadium.[29] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.\n
            In 2019, Tendulkar was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\n</item>
            <item>\nInformation\n\n While his exploits in Test cricket leave a lot to be desired, there is no doubting Rohit Sharmaâ€™s ability as a batsman.
                He is the first player in ODI history to have scored three double hundreds, including a world record individual score of 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014,
                and that tells you what a talent he is.\n
                The move to open with him in the shorter formats of the game worked wonders for him as well as India. After his impressive performance in the ICC Champions Trophy 2013,
                runs from his bat continued to flow. In the same year, in a high-scoring ODI series against Australia, Rohit amassed 491 runs in just 6 matches which included his
                first double-hundred. His innings of 209 came off 158 balls and had a total of 16 sixes.\n
                Rohit was ruled out of cricket due to a finger injury but came back all guns blazing, hitting his second ODI double-hundred, against Sri Lanka on November 13,
                2014, in Kolkata. Rohits 264 runs came in just 173 balls which till date is the highest individual score in ODI history. In the following year,
                Sharma was the second-highest run-scorer for India in the ODI World Cup. Just when it looked he would cement his place in the Test side after a good short run,
                another finger injury sidelined him during the New Zealand series at home. Sharma missed most of India successful home season in 2016.\n
                In yet another comeback to cricket, Rohit led the Mumbai franchise to their third Indian T20 league title in 6 years. In the last month of 2017, Rohit
                scored his third double century in ODIs, once again against Sri Lanka, and was also the captain of the team at that time. It was a memorable knock for him as it came on
                his wedding anniversary, a gift that his wife cherished by being the live audience. In the same month, against the same opposition but this time in the Twenty20
                format of the game, on December 22, Rohit equalled the world record of scoring the joint-fastest century of 35 balls in T20I.\n
                Rohit Sharma further proved his credentials as a captain when he led Mumbai to their record fourth trophy in the 2019 season. With the bat,
                Rohit was unstoppable and emerged as the leading run-scorer of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. He piled on 648 runs in 9 innings and also hammered
                5 centuries, a feat never achieved before. Post a dream World Cup, Rohit was selected in the Test squad for the West Indian tour, a format hes yet to boss.\n

            After seeing the craze for the game, he along with his brother got enrolled in Kiran Moreâ€™s International Academy at the age of 5 and 7 respectively.\n

            Finally in 2013, he made his debut in domestic Indian cricket team playing for Baroda.\n
            In 2015, John Wright saw great potential in him and therefore he was taken in IPL team of Mumbai Indians. He played well in the series then and rest in history.\n
            Later, his performance in 2016 finals of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy drew everyoneâ€™s attention on him after he played an unbeaten knock of 86 and led his team to win over
            Vidarbha cricket.\n
            He made his International debut against team Australia on 27 January 2016.\n</item>
